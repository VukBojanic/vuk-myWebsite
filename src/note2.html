            <p class="proj-desc">When you hear word enemy which is related to the team, first what is come in our mind is finances, meetings, deadlines. To reach our goals and make a product who is perfect we encounter an obstacle and we are usually our own worst enemies. Ego is what prevents us from asking for help, learning, collaborating and working hard.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">With Ego, we create the unhealthy environment, where we don't ask for help, we don't help to others teams members belief in our own importance, our arrogance. Ego leads us to think that we are special, important and inaccessible, and make us believe that we know more than we really do. This attitude forces our teammates to made wall betwine us and they're breaking interpersonal relations. Ego prevents us from building more great products and make progress forward.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p class="mb-0">“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. “
                 — Sun Tzu</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="proj-desc">They are so many great teams who broken ups under Ego. Its natural thing that we cant do and that we don't know everything. So we made teams with intent to collaborate and to cover the disadvantages of each other. One project doesn't mean that team has future nither hundreds of them. What future is for the team is mutual support and healthy relations where we can make progress as persons and professionals. </p>
            <p class="proj-desc">At the end, we should learn from other people's and overcome this state that can harm us and our team. This doesn't mean that we are unique and that we don't have something valuable to contribute, simply means that we don't need to be the main theme of the story. We should focus on the work and the process instead. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. - Richard Feynman.</p>
